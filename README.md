# Data Analytics Project
## Movie Recommendation System

### Description
* We have taken the movielens dataset, which is available in kaggle:
	* https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset 
	* https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset
	* https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1of45AVydAAaDwvQIZWl6Pyj8BkRx8IVM?usp=sharing (Here's the drive link for the entire dataset for our project)
	
* After pre-processing, for designing the **Model** we have saved the dataset in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1of45AVydAAaDwvQIZWl6Pyj8BkRx8IVM?usp=sharing over here.

* The codes for pre-processing of the dataset are present in preprocess1.ipynb and preprocess2.ipynb file.

* The file Recommendation_CosineSimilarity.ipynb contains the model implementation for Recommendation System using **Cosine Similarity**, which is an **Content-Based Filtering technique**. 


* The file collaborative_filtering_surprise.ipynb contains the model implementation for Recommendation System using **KNN**, which is an **Collaborative-Based Filtering technique**.
